 	<p>Hi Journal. This is my first entry. Today we learned to make a website using github and the Terminal. We also learned that the desktop is just fancy construct to make looking at things on our "desktop" easier. Until next time...</p>

	<p>こんにちわ Journal. A fatal error has occured in my terminal and I can no longer push my code. It's telling me that my branch has diverged from the main branch.  Since my code is broken for the time being, my website is in a fossilized sort of state; a snapshot of the past that is unchangable by me. I'll try to fix it by the end of the week. Until next time...</p>

	<p>Aloha Journal. Today was a big day for my website. i did a complete overhaul of my ui, added a new project, and did some minor tweaks. I finally put my vision to life as I made my index into a recreation of the angry birds world select screen. It found it very satisfying to final see my idea come to reality. I next added a halloween jumpscare to my projects. I finally added and wrote my about me page. A very eventful day, but a very satisfying end. Until next time...</p>
